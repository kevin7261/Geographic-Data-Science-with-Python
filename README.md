# Geographic-Data-Science-with-Python

This project is a collection of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various techniques in geographic data science using Python. The notebooks cover a range of analyses and visualizations commonly used in spatial analysis.

Key topics and analyses explored in this project include:

*   **Choropleth Mapping:** Creating thematic maps to visualize spatial distributions of data.
*   **Global Spatial Autocorrelation:** Assessing the overall clustering or dispersion of spatial patterns (e.g., using Moran's I).
*   **Local Spatial Autocorrelation:** Identifying local clusters and outliers in spatial data (e.g., using LISA - Local Indicators of Spatial Association).
*   **Point Pattern Analysis:** Analyzing the distribution of point locations to understand spatial patterns and processes.

The primary Python libraries used throughout these notebooks are:

*   **GeoPandas:** For working with geospatial data.
*   **PySAL (Python Spatial Analysis Library):** For advanced spatial statistical analysis.
*   **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn:** For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

The project also includes notebooks for data processing tasks, such as converting dengue fever case data and tax income data into formats suitable for spatial analysis.
